### Overview

- **`TCM.py`**: This script contains the complete implementation of the TCM (Tensor Confusion Matrix) for immediate use.
- **`Experiments` folder**: This directory includes all Python scripts used for the experimental setups and evaluations.

### Data and Model Weights

Due to restrictions, neither the dataset nor the pre-trained model weights are included in this repository. However, the dataset is publicly available online, and users can easily retrieve it by following the appropriate links.

Given the large size of the model weights, we recommend that users retrain the model from scratch to fully replicate the experiments.
