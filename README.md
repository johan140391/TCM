### Overview

- **`TCM.py`**: This script provides the full implementation of the Tensor Confusion Matrix (TCM) for immediate use.
- **`Experiments`**: This folder contains all the Python scripts required to reproduce the experiments.

### Data and Model Weights

The datasets are not included in this repository due to licensing restrictions. However, the datasets are publicly available online, and users can easily retrieve them.

Similarly, the trained model weights are not provided due to their large size. We recommend retraining the model from scratch to replicate the experiments.
